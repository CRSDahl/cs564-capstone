How to run so far :
- use ./set_code.sh to add a "secret code" to the
end of the clean_image.png: this creates secretImage.png which is what we will host on the webserver
- run python3 -m http.server 8000 to start up the web server

From inside Exfil Data:
- use ./initial_download.sh to mimic downloading during initial exploit
- use ./C2.sh to read image hosted on C2 web server
- C2 will download the image and run according to the code given in set_code.sh
